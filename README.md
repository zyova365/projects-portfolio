My Web Development Journey
==========================

Hi! I’m 15 (as of 2025) and I just started learning **HTML** and **CSS** a couple of days ago. To practice my skills, I built a **Link Tree clone** instead of just following tutorials—because I learn better by doing 😄.

This repository will keep growing as I create more projects. I’ll update this README regularly to showcase my progress.

Text Styling Practice Project
=============================

Hello! This project was made **2 days after my Link Tree clone**. I realized that my previous project lacked proper text styling, so I spent some time learning and practicing it.

I’m still not great at it yet, but I’m improving little by little. This project is part of my journey to build better front-end skills.

Second Linktree Clone (Improved Version)
========================================

Alrighty! A lot has happened since I learned how to style text and work with **divs**. I decided to make another Linktree clone and I’m so glad I did, because it turned out _so_ good and way more professional than my first one!

In just 6 days of learning, I’ve picked up a lot, including **z-index** and **layering** in CSS. I’m really proud of how far I’ve come already.

I’ll be taking a short break of around 2 days from coding.**Date:** 11/12/2025


Recipe Card Project (Frontend Mentor)
=====================================

A lot happened during this time there was a wedding, so those “2 days off” turned into being pretty busy. About 3 days ago, while browsing **Frontend Mentor**, I came across a recipe card design and decided to build it.

This project took me around **2 days**, along with all the wedding chaos 😅.

This project really pushed me. It tested my **layout skills**, **text styling**, and **color theory**, and most importantly, I learned how to use **Flexbox (display: flex)**. I also realized that my earlier projects weren’t responsive and mostly worked only on my own device—but that’s okay. I don’t hide my mistakes; I learn from them.

So far, this has been the **hardest and most important project** I’ve worked on. I didn’t watch any tutorials I just looked at the design and told myself, _“I can build this,”_ and I did. 💪

Honestly, this project taught me more than any video ever could. I’m really proud of how far I’ve come in such a short time. It’s only been about **8 days** since I started learning web development **16/12/2025**.


JavaScript Number Counter Project
=================================

Hello everyone! I missed you all sorry for being gone for so long. I was sick and dealing with some family issues, and things got a bit chaotic.

But I still managed to cook up something 👨‍🍳🔥I built a **number counter** with **increase**, **decrease**, and **reset** buttons using **JavaScript**, along with **HTML** and **CSS**.

Last night, I watched a simple YouTube tutorial covering JavaScript basics like **variables**, **IDs**, **const**, and some basic math. Today, I felt the confidence and the itch to build something on my own, so I did.

I’m far from perfect, but I’m learning step by step, and I’m really proud of myself for this one. We’re cooking slowly, but we’re definitely cooking. 💪 28/12/2025
