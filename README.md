My Web Development Journey
==========================

Hi! I’m 15 (as of 2025) and I just started learning **HTML** and **CSS** a couple of days ago. To practice my skills, I built a **Link Tree clone** instead of just following tutorials—because I learn better by doing 😄.

This repository will keep growing as I create more projects. I’ll update this README regularly to showcase my progress.

Text Styling Practice Project
=============================

Hello! This project was made **2 days after my Link Tree clone**. I realized that my previous project lacked proper text styling, so I spent some time learning and practicing it.

I’m still not great at it yet, but I’m improving little by little. This project is part of my journey to build better front-end skills.

Second Linktree Clone (Improved Version)
========================================

Alrighty! A lot has happened since I learned how to style text and work with **divs**. I decided to make another Linktree clone and I’m so glad I did, because it turned out _so_ good and way more professional than my first one!

In just 6 days of learning, I’ve picked up a lot, including **z-index** and **layering** in CSS. I’m really proud of how far I’ve come already.

I’ll be taking a short break of around 2 days from coding.**Date:** 11/12/2025
