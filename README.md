My Web Development Journey
==========================

Hi! I’m 15 (as of 2025) and I just started learning **HTML** and **CSS** a couple of days ago. To practice my skills, I built a **Link Tree clone** instead of just following tutorials—because I learn better by doing 😄.

This repository will keep growing as I create more projects. I’ll update this README regularly to showcase my progress.
